API Doumentation

ALL my rest services are under PaymentService.java class
 
@POST
it doesn't have a parameter.
I have created a rest service for a new payment.

@GET:
it doesn't have any parameter.
1) I created a rest service to get all the payments detail.

@GET 
"/findID/{id}"
2) I also created a rest service to find a payment of a specific detail.

@Delete
"/deletePayment/{id}"
My rest service could delete a payment with a specific id.
